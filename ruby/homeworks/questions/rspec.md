# RSpec Homework

For tonight's homework, we will be implementing some specs for the Dessert class!

Here's what you need to do:
  1. Download the [project skeleton][rspec-homework]
  2. Review the `dessert.rb` file to see what functionality exists.  Do not edit or add any code to this file.
  3. In the `dessert_spec.rb` file, implement all of the pending specs (the `it` statements without blocks).  
  4. Run your specs and see that they all pass!

[rspec-homework]: rspec-homework.zip?raw=true

**Note:** Technically, this is not Test Driven Development since we've provided the Dessert class for you. That's okay! The idea for tonight's homework is to familiarize you with RSpec syntax and methods. Enjoy your dessert!

After you finish the homework, or if you get stuck on one of the problems, you can view the solutions [here][rspec-solutions].
