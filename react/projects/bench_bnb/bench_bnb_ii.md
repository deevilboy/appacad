# BenchBnB Day 2

## Phase 7: React Router

We'll need to modify our entry file, `bench_bnb.jsx`, to add routes.

* Install `ReactRouter`: `npm install --save --save-exact react-router@2.0.1`.
  * Use that exact version, as other versions might cause compatibility issues.
* In your entry file, require `Router`, `Route`, `IndexRoute`, and `hashHistory` from the `ReactRouter`.
* Create a `<Router>` that gets rendered by `ReactDom` when the page loads.
* Create an `App` react component that renders `{this.props.children}`. Set this component to your root `<Route>`.
* Inside your `App` `<Route>`, render the `Search` component as the default
`<IndexRoute>`.

Your entry file should now roughly resemble this:

  ```javascript
    // frontend/bench_bnb.js.jsx
  const React = require('react');
  const ReactDOM = require('react-dom');

  const ReactRouter = require('react-router');
  const Router = ReactRouter.Router;
  const Route = ReactRouter.Route;
  const IndexRoute = ReactRouter.IndexRoute;
  const hashHistory = ReactRouter.hashHistory;

  const Search = require('./components/Search');

  const App = React.createClass({
    render() {
      return (
          <div>
            <header><h1>Bench BnB</h1></header>
            {this.props.children}
          </div>
      );
    }
  });

  const appRouter = (
    <Router history={hashHistory}>
      <Route path="/" component={App}>
        <IndexRoute component={Search}/>
      </Route>
    </Router>
  );

  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const root = document.getElementById('content');
    ReactDOM.render(appRouter, root);
  });
  ```

Verify that your app still renders correctly before moving on.

## Phase 8: Creating Benches

### Adding a Bench Form

* Create a new React component, `BenchForm`. This should render a simple form
  with 4 fields:
    * Description
    * Number of seats
    * Latitude
    * Longitude
* Add a new `seating` column to the `benches` table.
  * This new column will store how many people can sit together on the
    bench at the same time.
* Create a new `<Route>`, `/benches/new`, for your `BenchForm` component.
  *  Test the route by navigating to `/#/benches/new`; the map should disappear.
* Write a `create` method on your `BenchesController` and give it a corresponding
  route in `routes.rb`.
* Add a `createBench` function to the `BenchApiUtil`. It should make a `POST`
  request to your API.
* Test `BenchApiUtil.createBench` from the console.
* Add `BenchActions` to `createBench` and `receiveBench`.
* `BenchForm` should call `BenchActions.createBench` upon submission.

### Navigating to the BenchForm

Filling in coordinates manually is a major pain; Let's make things a little easier
by bringing up a new bench form when a user clicks on the map and pre-filling it
with latitude and longitude based on where they clicked.

Because `BenchMap` and `BenchForm` live under different routes, We can't simply pass props between them to convey our click information. We will need to encode our parameters in a client-side query string.

#### Redirecting with coordinates

Let's get down to business. Add a `"click"` handler to the map. It
should:

* Grab the coordinates from the click event.
* Use the router's [hashHistory][react-history] to redirect to the `BenchForm`
  URL, providing the `lat` and lng` as query params.

To pass `lat` and `lng` as query params:
  0.  Require the `hashHistory` module in the `BenchMap`.

  ```javascript
    const hashHistory = require('react-router').hashHistory;
  ```

  0.  Use `hashHistory#push` to send data along with the new `pathname`.

  ```javascript
    _handleClick(coords){
      hashHistory.push({
        pathname: "benches/new",
        query: coords
      });
    }
  ```

Test this before moving on. You should be able to click the map and make the
browser redirect to a URL that looks something like:

  */#/benches/new?lat=37.79153217974085&lng=-122.40194320678711*

### Pre-filling the form
Inside of the `BenchForm` component, pre-fill the value of the lat/lng input
fields by accessing `this.props.location.query`. Then make sure the lat/lng input
fields are disabled so that users can't edit them.

Awesome! Now users can easily create new benches.

## Phase 9: Front-End User Authentication

In this phase, we are going to implement front-end user sign-up and login.
Goodbye Rails views; hello, single-page app!

**Our authentication pattern must:**
  * sign up new users
  * know who's logged in
  * log users in
  * log them out
  * restrict access to certain routes based on whether someone is logged in

There are a few pieces to solving this puzzle. We still need backend auth to protect our rails routes. But we also need to communicate our logged-in status to the frontend so that we render the correct components. To do this, we will have a SessionStore which keeps track of our current user. We'll also have an ErrorStore to keep track of any login errors.

The SessionStore and ErrorStore will each need their own flux cycles. Then we'll ensure that our SessionStore receives the current user by attaching some current user info to the window. Before rendering any component, we'll use an onEnter callback on our `<Route/>`s to check if a user is logged in.

**Read through the instructions for
the entire phase before building anything.** This will give you the context to
understand each individual step.

### 1. Build Your Backend.

Read the instructions below, and then create an API with the following
endpoints:

  * [POST] api/users: "users#create" (signup),
  * [POST] api/session: "session#create" (login),
  * [DELETE] api/session: "session#destroy" (logout)

**Create a `User` model, `UsersController`, and `SessionsController`.** Follow
the basic pattern you used during the [Rails curriculum][rails], with some key
differences:

* **Namespace**: Your controllers should live under an `Api` namespace.
* **Response Format**: render JSON formatted responses by default.
* **Views**: You'll want an **`api/users/show.json.jbuilder`**, which you can use for multiple controller actions. This should delegate to partial **`api/users/_user.json.jbuilder`**, which we'll use later.
* **`Sessions#destroy`**: render an empty `{}` upon successful logout.
  * Render a `404` message if there is no `current_user` to logout.
* **Auth Errors**: Render auth errors in your response with a corresponding error status.
  * Use `@user.errors.full_messages` when applicable.
  * Render single errors in an array
  * ex. `render json: ['Invalid credentials'], status: 401`
  * **Caution**: Error responses are formatted differently than normal
  responses.

Test your routes using `$.ajax` in the console before moving on.

### 2. Build Your Frontend

Once your API is fully built and tested, set up the following flux architecture
components.

#### SessionApiUtil

Create a `SessionApiUtil` with the following methods:
  * **`signup`:** POST 'api/users'
  * **`login`:** POST 'api/session'
  * **`logout`:** DELETE 'api/session'

Each `SessionApiUtil` method should take `success` and `error` arguments and use those for its ajax success/error callbacks. For example:

```js
anApiCall(otherArgs, success, error) {
  $.ajax({
    url: 'random/route',
    // other ajax params
    success,
    error
    // this is ES6 shorthand for:
    // success: success,
    // error: error
  })
}
```

Before moving on, put `SessionApiUtil` on the window in your entry file and test
it out. Make sure all your endpoints behave properly for both successful and
erroneous requests. Pay attention to:
* the `Network` tab of Dev Tools
* the Rails server logs

#### SessionStore

Create a `SessionStore` that will keep track of the current user.

**Variables:**
  * `_currentUser`: should be `{}` if no one is logged in

**Closures** (i.e. private functions only available in this file):
  * `_login`: set `_currentUser` and `__emitChange()`
  * `_logout`: set `_currentUser` to `{}` and `__emitChange()`

**Public Methods:**
  * `currentUser`: a reader
  * `isUserLoggedIn`: should return a boolean of whether a user is logged in
    * hint: you can check `_currentUser.id`

**`SessionStore.__onDispatch`**
  * Define `SessionConstants` for `LOGIN` and `LOGOUT`
  * Setup `SessionStore.__onDispatch` to call the appropriate methods

#### SessionActions

0. Create **`signup`, `login`, and `logout`** methods:
Each method should:
  * Invoke the appropriate `SessionApiUtil` action.
  * Pass `receiveCurrentUser` as a `success` callback.
  * We'll write the `error` callback later

0. Write `receiveCurrentUser`
  * dispatch to the `SessionStore`

Attach your `SessionActions` to the window and test them out before moving on.

### 3. Create `LoginForm` and `SignupForm`

Create a `LoginForm` component and a React `Route` for it.

  * `render` a form for users to enter their username and password.
  * `onSubmit`, call your `SessionActions#login` and pass in the credentials.
  * After a successful login, redirect to your root Route (`/`)
    * In `#componentDidMount`, register a listener with the `SessionStore`.
    * When the `SessionStore` emits change, check if a user is logged in.
    * If so, redirect them (`this.context.router.push("/")`).

Once your `LoginForm` works, make a similar `SignupForm` component and route that calls `SessionActions#signup`.

### 4. Errors

Your forms should display errors if user submissions cause validation/authentication errors.

####  Create an `ErrorStore`.

**Variables:**
* `_errors`: an `[]` for your errors
* `_form`: The store should only ever have the errors for a single form. This
variable should store the name of the form currently being tracked as a string.

**Public Methods:**
* `errors`: takes a `form` argument and returns a copy of `_errors` if and only
if `form === _form`.

**Closures:**
* `_setErrors`: takes a `form` name and an `errors` object and saves them in `_form`
and `_errors`; emits change.
* `_clearErrors`: sets `_form` and `_errors` to `""` and `[]` respectively; emits
change.

**`__onDispatch`:**
* Create `ErrorConstants` and handle the following `actionTypes`:
  * `ErrorConstants.SET_ERRORS`
  * `ErrorConstants.CLEAR_ERRORS`

####  Define `ErrorActions`

Define the following actions:
* `setErrors`
* `clearErrors`

Both methods should take the raw API error response generated by your `$.ajax` call and dispatch the proper error information to your `ErrorStore`. Keep in mind that Rails error responses return XHR objects, not raw response data, which lives in the `.responseJSON` attribute of the XHR object returned.

Once you've written these methods, return to your `SessionActions` and `SessionApiUtil`:

* Modify `SessionActions` to pass `ErrorActions.setErrors` as the `error` argument to your `SessionApiUtil` methods.

####  Update your `LoginForm` and `SignupForm`

Your components should listen to your `ErrorStore` on `componentDidMount`. Make
sure they track `this.state.errors`. When the store changes, `setState` to
the new errors on the form. Reminder:  `ErrorStore.errors` should check the `form` so that LoginForm doesn't render signup errors and vice versa.

Update both forms to `render` their errors if any are present.

### 5. Create a greeting in the header.

Modify your app to provide a greeting to users when they are signed in.
  * In the `App` component, render a `<header>` with information about the
  `SessionStore#currentUser`.
  * If a user is logged in, display their username and a logout button.
    * `onClick` of logout button, `preventDefault` and `SessionActions#logout`
  * If user IS NOT logged in, give them links to "#/login" and "#/signup"

### 6. Bootstrap the current user before the app mounts.

When our static `root` page loads, our app mounts without being aware of who the
current user is.

One solution to this problem is to create another API hook that returns the
current user and then fetch that information when the app mounts. However, since
the request would be asynchronous, our app would momentarily have no current
user. This would cause it to briefly render in a 'not-logged-in' state and then
re-render when the current user was received, causing a strange, flickering
effect. To circumvent this, we'll bootstrap the current user alongside our html
when the page initially loads.

#### Edit your `root.html.erb`

Add a `<script></script>` element to the top of your `root.html.erb` file. Give
it a `type="text/javascript"`.

Inside your `<script>`, we're going to assign `window.currentUser`. In order to
get the proper value, we'll need to ask our controller for the `current_user`
and then `render` that information inside the script tag using `ERB`
interpolation. The result will be a hard-coded assignment in our rendered html
that looks something like this:

```html
...
<script type="text/javascript">
    window.currentUser = {"id":3,"username":"bobross"}
</script>

<main id="content"></main>
...

```

where `{"id":3,"username":"bobross"}` is inserted via `ERB`.

#### Interpolate the current user information

In your script, assign your `window.currentUser` to an erb expression:

```js
  window.currentUser = <%=  %>
```

Make sure to use `<%= %>` so that the result of your ruby code is rendered into the
script ( it will eventually return a JSON object).

Inside your erb expression, `render` your jbuilder `_user` partial, passing it
the `current_user`. To prevent rails from automatically looking for a html
partial, specify the whole path, including `.json.jbuilder`.Mark your `render`
result `html_safe` to avoid escaping certain characters. You should get a JS-
compatible object to assign to `window.currentUser`. Add interpolation around
your  `window.currentUser=` assignment so that it only runs if someone is logged
in. You should have something like this:

```html

<script type="text/javascript">
  <% if logged_in? %>
    window.currentUser = <%= render("api/users/user.json.jbuilder",
      user: current_user).html_safe %>
  <% end %>
</script>

```

Log in, refresh your page, and check out your `elements` in the Dev Tools.
Verify that the  `script` contains an object literal of the current user and
properly assigns  `window.currentUser`.

Finally, inside the `DOMContentLoaded` callback in your entry file, call
`SessionActions.receiveCurrentUser(window.currentUser)` before
`ReactDom.render`. This will ensure that the `SessionStore` has the
`_currentUser` before any of your components render.

Test that your bootstrapping worked by logging in and refreshing the page. If you
don't get logged out, it worked!

### 7. Protect your front-end routes.

Let's make sure users can't get to our "/benches/new" or "benches/:id/review" routes on the frontend if they're not logged in.

  * Add an `onEnter` prop to the Routes we want to protect:

    ```html
    <Route path="benches/new" component = { BenchForm } onEnter={ _ensureLoggedIn } />
    ```
  * Define an `_ensureLoggedIn` function in your entry file. It should:
    * take `nextState` and `replace` arguments. React-Router will pass these arguments to any onEnter callback.
    * check `SessionStore#isUserLoggedIn`.
    * If `true`, do nothing.
    * Otherwise, use the `replace` function to redirect to "/login". (Remember that `replace` won't
    add a "fake" entry to the browser's history, whereas `push` will.)
    * onEnter functions take an optional third argument, an `asyncDoneCallback`. We don't need this because `_ensureLoggedIn` runs synchronously.

Test your work before continuing.

## Phase 10: Filtering By Seating

We're going to implement search filters on our `Search` components to filter benches by their geographic bounds and number of seats.

### Update your API.

* Update your `Benches#index`:
  * Modify `bench_params` to accept `:max_seating` and `:min_seating`.
  * Filter your `@benches` by `params[:max_seating]` and
  `filters[:min_seating]`, if present.

### `FilterParamsStore`

* Create a `FilterParamsStore`. Your store should keep track of `minSeats`, `maxSeats`, and `bounds`, and `emitChange` whenever those values change.

* Create a public method for retrieving the store's information.

* Create `FilterConstants` for updating your max seats, min seats, and bounds. Dispatch the appropriate actions in your `FilterStore`.


### `FilterActions`

* Create `FilterActions` that `updateMaxSeating`, `updateMinSeating`, and `updateBounds` by dispatching to your `FilterStore`.

### Update your `Search` components.

**`Search`:**
  * Modify `Search` to hold `filterParams` information in its state.
  * Add a `FilterStoreParams` listener to `Search` that:
    * calls `setState` for `filterParams`.
    * calls `BenchActions.fetchAllBenches` with `FilterStore.params` to update the `BenchStore`.

**`BenchMap`:**
  * Refactor your `BenchMap` component to call `FilterActions.updateBounds`
  whenever it idles.

Check that your map is correctly rendering benches before moving on.

### `Filters` component ###

Create a `Filters` component that will render a form for filtering benches by
seating.
* It should be a child component of the `Search` view (not a child route, but
component rendered within `Search` itself).
* It should input fields for `maxSeats` and `minSeats`.
* When the user types in any field, call an appropriate `FilterAction` to update your `FilterStore`.

Verify that your `Filters` form can cause your `BenchIndex` and `BenchMap` to re-populate before moving on.

## Phase 11: Show Page
Create a `BenchShow` component. It should be a full-page component displaying a
single bench's information and a map showing the bench. Your `BenchShow` page should mount whenever someone clicks on an item in your `BenchIndex` or a marker in your `BenchMap`.

* Create a new `Route` for your `BenchShow` that takes a `benchId` param.
* Nest a `BenchMap` in your `BenchShow`, passing the bench as a prop.
* Center the map on the single bench and prevent the map from being dragged.

## Phase 12: Reviews

Show reviews of a bench on `BenchShow`. Reviews for a bench should comprise:
* A rating from 1 to 5
* A comment field

Add a `ReviewIndex` and `ReviewForm`. `ReviewIndex` should show the average score for a bench and also list the reviews for that bench. Modify and add the appropriate API endpoints, actions, utils, and components.


## Phase 13: Pictures!
* when you create a new bench, allow a user to also add a photo using
  [Cloudinary][cloudinary-js]!
* You will need to create a new column in your benches table.
* Display these pictures on both the show page and the index.

## Bonus
* Every bench can have multiple photos!
* Show page should have a carousel!
* Display the score as a list of star images!
* Users can favorite benches!
* Style your page!
